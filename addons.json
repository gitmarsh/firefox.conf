When DownloadHelper detects embedded videos it can access for download, the toolbar icon highlights and a simple menu allows you to download files by simply clicking an item.\n\nFor instance, if you go to a YouTube page, you'll be able to download the video directly on your file system. It also works with most other popular video sites like DailyMotion, Facebook, Periscope, Vimeo, Twitch, Liveleak, Vine, UStream, Fox, Bloomberg, RAI, France 2-3, Break, Metacafe, and thousands of others.\n\nVideo DownloadHelper supports several types of streamings, making the add-on unique amongst Video downloaders: HTTP, HLS, DASH, … Whenever a site uses a non-supported streaming technology, Video DownloadHelper is able to capture the media directly from the screen and generate a video file.\n\nBesides downloading, Video DownloadHelper is also capable of making file conversions (i.e. change audio and video formats) and aggregation (combining separate audio and video into a single file). This is an upgrade feature that helps pay for the free stuff (we need to eat too). You are not compelled to use conversion for downloading videos from websites, and you can avoid picking variants marked as ADP to avoid the need for aggregation.\n\nVideo overview on how to use Video DownloadHelper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZT8yI60k_4\n\nSupport can be obtained from the dedicated support forum.\n\nPlease stay tuned by following us on Twitter (@downloadhelper), or Facebook.","weeklyDownloads":48910,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"mig","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/32479/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/25/25993.png?modified=1622132280","width":200,"height":150,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/25/25993.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":150,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154820.png?modified=1622132280","width":327,"height":124,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154820.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":327,"thumbnailHeight":124,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper animated toobar icon"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154824.png?modified=1622132280","width":250,"height":200,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154824.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":250,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154822.png?modified=1622132280","width":361,"height":289,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154822.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":361,"thumbnailHeight":289,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154826.png?modified=1622132281","width":320,"height":317,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154826.jpg?modified=1622132281","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":317,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper available actions"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154828.png?modified=1622132281","width":293,"height":250,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154828.jpg?modified=1622132281","thumbnailWidth":293,"thumbnailHeight":250,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper quality variants settings"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.2863,"reviewCount":13229,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/reviews/","updateDate":1657037142000},{"id":"addon@darkreader.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-32.png?modified=3f34e276","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-64.png?modified=3f34e276","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-128.png?modified=3f34e276"},"name":"Dark Reader","version":"4.9.52","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3968561/darkreader-4.9.52.xpi","homepageURL":"https://darkreader.org/","supportURL":"https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader","description":"Dark mode for every website.

LanguageTool detects many errors that a simple spell checker cannot, such as grammar issues, commonly confused words, and punctuation oversights. Additionally, LanguageTool offers style suggestions to elevate your writing: synonym replacements for overused words, concise rephrasing of wordy sentences, and formal alternatives to commonly used expressions.\n\nLanguageTool is designed with simplicity in mind, instantly analyzing your text as you type. It is compatible with most platforms, including social networks such as Twitter and LinkedIn, and e-mail services such as Gmail.\n\nWith LanguageTool, our aim is to give users a full-feature grammar checker and proofreader that will enable them to have control and confidence over their content. While LanguageTool is a vital extension for non-native speakers, it also recognizes many mistakes that are frequently made by native speakers. This grammar and spelling correction works across several varieties of commonly spoken languages, and is capable of distinguishing between American and British English. LanguageTool also features a personal dictionary for exceptions or words that you might commonly use, but are not found in a conventional dictionary; it will learn to recognize these words for future grammar checking and proofreading.\n\nUnlike other services like Grammarly (a.k.a. Grammerly :-), QuillBot, and Ginger, LanguageTool supports more than 25 languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Polish, and Russian (see below for the complete list).\n\nYour privacy is important to us: By default, this extension will check your text by sending it to languagetool.org over a securely encrypted connection.

Please read the limitations below...","fullDescription":"A simple addon that does one simple thing. It allows you to scroll through your tabs with the mouse wheel, while holding the right button down (and/or keyboard modifiers). It directly changes the tab as you scroll, rather than showing a popup of tabs to scroll through. After moving to Firefox 57 the old addon I used for this purpose stopped working. I could not find a replacement, without going for a big addon with full gesture support like Foxy Gestures, so I wrote this one. It has minimal options: wrap around at the ends of the tab list (default on), invert the direction of scrolling, scrolling rate-limit (default off) and a selection of keyboard modifier keys.\n\nLimitations:\n- This addon works on Windows from Firefox v57 (and maybe earlier) and Linux from Firefox v58. Previously it did not work on OSX (due to lack of button info on the scroll event), but as of v1.0.6 I have got OSX to work via a different mechanism.\n- This addon operates from within your tab content i.e. the mouse must be over the page, not over the tab bar itself (there is no WebExtension API for this).\n- This addon will not work on most non-webpage tabs of Firefox, such as the Firefox options page, addons page or the new tab page. Mozilla also blocks addons from operating on pages from the addons.mozilla.org site itself.\n- Some pages that capture key presses could potentially interfere with the keyboard modifiers option (1 report with a specific Google Docs spreadsheet).\n\nPlease let me know if you have any difficulties. Bugs can be reported on GitHub.\n\nPermissions:\n- The storage permission is required to save the settings mentioned above.\n- The browserSettings permission is required to enable the option needed for Linux/OSX support.\n- The scroll handler needs access to all webpages in order to work from them. This results in a scary permission request on install saying the addon can \"Access your data for all websites\". This is a just stock warning meaning the addon acts on all pages - please be assured your data is not being accessed at all. If you are concerned please check the source code in the xpi or on GitHub.","weeklyDownloads":9,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Richard Antony Burton","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13483584/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1333,"reviewCount":30,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabscroller/reviews/","updateDate":1624629058000},{"id":"{4e507435-d65f-4467-a2c0-16dbae24f288}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-32.2b26add4b394.png","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-64.d144b50f2bb8.png","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-128.452018499894.png"},"name":"Breeze Dark","version":"2.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/2406962/breezedarktheme-2.0.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"description":"Theme for better visual integration with the KDE Breeze Dark theme.","fullDescription":null,"weeklyDownloads":96,"type":"theme","creator":{"name":"schlagma","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/14474816/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/full/2923/2923174.png?modified=1622822424","width":680,"height":92,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/thumbs/2923/2923174.png?modified=1622822424","thumbnailWidth":473,"thumbnailHeight":64},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/full/2923/2923177.svg?modified=1622822424","width":720,"height":92,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/thumbs/2923/2923177.jpg?modified=1622822424","thumbnailWidth":720,"thumbnailHeight":92}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.9259,"reviewCount":5,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/breezedarktheme/reviews/","updateDate":1557739041000},{"id":"{bd490218-d863-45c9-8ffa-490ba0a91577}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-32.2b26add4b394.png","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-64.d144b50f2bb8.png","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-128.452018499894.png"},"name":"Rotate Image","version":"1.1.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3749151/rotate_image-1.1.0.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"description":"Adds a context menu item which allows you to rotate an image (element) on a web page in +90 degrees steps.","fullDescription":null,"weeklyDownloads":11,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Chris Doerr","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13452771/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":5,"reviewCount":1,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rotate-image/reviews/","updateDate":1616663486000},{"id":"BeautifulRedBlur@Godie","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-32.2b26add4b394.png","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-64.d144b50f2bb8.png","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-128.452018499894.png"},"name":"Beautiful Red Blur","version":"1.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3973343/beautiful_red_blur-1.0.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":"https://github.com/Godiesc/","description":"Tema Al Estilo Blur Para Firefox.
